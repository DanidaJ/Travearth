## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### State Management:
```typescript
// Destinations (Step 1)
const [destinations, setDestinations] = useState<Destination[]>([])
const [goingDate, setGoingDate] = useState<Date>()
const [returnDate, setReturnDate] = useState<Date>()
const [tripType, setTripType] = useState("")
const [totalDistance, setTotalDistance] = useState(0)

// Activities (Step 2)
const [currentDay, setCurrentDay] = useState(1)
const [activities, setActivities] = useState<Record<number, Activity[]>>({})
const [newActivityName, setNewActivityName] = useState("")
const [isCalculating, setIsCalculating] = useState(false)
```

### Data Structures:
```typescript
interface Destination {
  country: string
  capital: string
  lat: number
  lng: number
  airport: { name: string; code: string; lat: number; lng: number }
}

interface Activity {
  id: string
  name: string
  location: string
  lat: number
  lng: number
  time: string
  duration: number
  type: "sightseeing" | "dining" | "adventure" | "cultural" | "nature"
  carbonImpact: number
  distance: number
}
```

### Performance Optimizations:
- `useMemo` for trip days calculation
- `useMemo` for map markers generation
- `useMemo` for map route polyline
- `useCallback` for addActivity function
- `useCallback` for removeActivity function
- `useCallback` for getDayCarbon calculation
- Dynamic map import to avoid SSR issues

### Map Configuration:
- Center: Destination capital coordinates
- Zoom: 12 (city-level view)
- Height: 400px
- Scroll wheel zoom: Enabled
- Custom marker icons from CDN

## 📊 CARBON CALCULATION LOGIC

### Transport Emissions (Future Step 3):
```
Flight:  0.255 kg CO₂/km
Train:   0.041 kg CO₂/km
Car:     0.192 kg CO₂/km
Taxi:    0.211 kg CO₂/km
Bus:     0.089 kg CO₂/km
Metro:   0.055 kg CO₂/km
Walk:    0 kg CO₂/km
Bike:    0 kg CO₂/km
```

### Activity Emissions (Current):
```
Sightseeing:  0.1 kg CO₂   (minimal impact)
Dining:       2.5 kg CO₂   (food production)
Adventure:    5.0 kg CO₂   (equipment, transport)
Cultural:     0.2 kg CO₂   (indoor, minimal)
Nature:       0.05 kg CO₂  (zero-carbon hiking)
```

## 🧪 TESTING SCENARIOS

### Test Case 1: Single Destination Trip
1. Select France
2. Choose dates: Oct 20 → Oct 25 (5 days)
3. Should show: INTERNATIONAL badge, ~8500km distance
4. Add activities: Visit Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum
5. Map should show Paris with blue activity markers

### Test Case 2: Multi-Destination Trip
1. Select France, then Switzerland, then Italy
2. Choose dates: Oct 20 → Oct 30 (10 days)
3. Should calculate cumulative distance
4. Plan activities for each destination
5. Map updates for each day

### Test Case 3: Activity Carbon Tracking

## 💡 KEY INNOVATIONS

1. **Hardcoded Starting Point**: No need for browser geolocation or user input
2. **Country-First Approach**: Simplified UX - select countries, not cities
3. **Visual Map Planning**: See your route as you plan
4. **Real-Time Carbon Feedback**: Immediate impact visibility
5. **Activity-Centric Planning**: Focus on what you'll do, not just where you'll go
6. **Type-Based Carbon Calculation**: Different activities have different impacts
7. **Day-by-Day Organization**: Clear mental model for planning

## 🔗 API INTEGRATION READINESS

### Backend Endpoints Needed (Step 3):
```
POST /api/ecoplan
Body: {
  destinations: Destination[],
  activities: Record<number, Activity[]>,
  goingDate: Date,
  returnDate: Date
}
Response: {
  optimizedRoute: OptimizedRoute,
  hotelRecommendations: Hotel[],
  transportSuggestions: TransportMode[],
  carbonSavings: number
}
```

### Geocoding API (Production):
Replace simulated geocoding with:
- Google Maps Geocoding API
- Mapbox Geocoding API
- OpenCage Geocoding API

---

## 📈 METRICS & ANALYTICS

### User Engagement Points:
- Destination selections
- Activity additions
- Activity types chosen
- Time spent planning per day
- Carbon footprint awareness (view count)
- Map interactions (clicks, zoom)

### Carbon Metrics:
- Total trip carbon
- Carbon per day
- Carbon by activity type
- Carbon saved through optimization (Step 3)

---

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Simulated Geocoding**: Activities placed randomly near destination
   - **Fix**: Integrate real geocoding API

2. **Static Country List**: Only 12 countries available
   - **Fix**: Add full country database or API

3. **No Hotel Selection**: Activities assume single hotel per destination
   - **Fix**: Add hotel booking API integration

4. **Transport Mode Not Selectable**: Auto-determined in Step 3
   - **Fix**: Allow manual selection in Step 4

5. **No Route Persistence**: Lost on refresh
   - **Fix**: Save to MongoDB after Step 5
