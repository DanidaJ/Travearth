# 🎯 URGENT FIX APPLIED - You Were Looking at the Wrong Page!

## ❌ The Problem

You were at: `/dashboard/trips/create` (old basic form)  
The new planner was at: `/dashboard/trips/plan` (different URL!)

## ✅ The Solution

**I just replaced the old form with the advanced planner!**

---

## 🔧 What I Changed (Just Now)

### **File 1:** `client/app/dashboard/trips/create/page.tsx`

**BEFORE (what you saw):**
```tsx
// Basic HTML form - NO AI features
<Input placeholder="Trip name" />
<Input type="date" />
<Textarea placeholder="Description" />
```

**AFTER (what you'll see now):**
```tsx
// Advanced AI-powered 3-step wizard
<AdvancedTripPlanner />
```

### **File 2:** `client/app/dashboard/trips/page.tsx`

**BEFORE:**
```tsx
// Mock fake data
const upcomingTrips = [
  { name: "Costa Rica Adventure", ... },  // FAKE!
  { name: "Nordic Escape", ... }  // FAKE!
]
```

**AFTER:**
```tsx
// Real data from MongoDB
const response = await fetch('/api/trips')
const trips = await response.json()  // REAL!
```
